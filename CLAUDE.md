# CLAUDE.md — DOMOVINA.ai

## Project Overview

Flutter web/mobile app for AI-processed Croatian podcast episodes.
All data loads from CDN (`cdn.domovina.ai`). Deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

- **Package ID**: `ai.domovina`
- **Display name**: `DOMOVINA.ai`
- **Platforms**: Web (primary), Android, iOS, macOS

## Build & Deploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh          # release build + deploy + CDN purge
./scripts/deploy.sh --debug  # profile build (unminified) + deploy + CDN purge
```

Deploy script runs: `flutter pub get` → `flutter analyze` → `flutter build web` → `wrangler pages deploy` → Cloudflare cache purge → HTTP verification.

`.env` must contain `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_PURGE_TOKEN`.

## Known Issues & Gotchas

### SharedPreferences crashes on web release builds

`SharedPreferences` throws `MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method getAll on channel plugins.flutter.io/shared_preferences)` in dart2js release mode. The method channel plugin registration is stripped during minification.

**Fix**: Web uses `window.localStorage` directly via `package:web`. Native (iOS/Android/macOS) uses `SharedPreferences` normally. Gated by `kIsWeb` in `home_screen.dart`.

**Rule**: Never use `SharedPreferences` on web. Always check `kIsWeb` and use `localStorage` for browser persistence.

### ensureSemantics crashes on web release builds

`SemanticsBinding.instance.ensureSemantics()` creates a DOM overlay that causes `Uncaught Error` during the first frame render in release web builds. Removed from `main.dart`.

**Rule**: Do not call `ensureSemantics()` for web builds.

### flutter_svg crashes on web

`flutter_svg` (`SvgPicture.asset`) causes `Uncaught Error` on web builds. Replaced with `Image.asset` using PNG version of the logo.

**Rule**: Use PNG (`Image.asset`) instead of SVG for in-app images on web.

### Cloudflare Pages pretty URLs

Cloudflare auto-strips `.html` extensions (`/social-test.html` → `/social-test`). The worker in `_worker.js` checks for `.html` files in ASSETS before falling back to SPA routing.

### Cache purge required after deploy

Cloudflare CDN caches aggressively. Always purge cache after deploy (the deploy script does this automatically). Without purge, users may see stale versions.

## Logging

`main.dart` exports a `log()` function that prefixes messages with `[DOMOVINA v{version}]`. Use it throughout the app for console debugging:

```dart
import '../main.dart' show log;

log('MyWidget.build()');
log('fetch complete: ${items.length} items');
```

Logs are visible in browser DevTools console and help trace the exact point of failure in release builds where stack traces are minified.

**Rule**: When adding new async operations or widget builds that could fail, add `log()` calls at key checkpoints. This is critical because release web builds minify all symbols — without logs, errors show only `Uncaught Error` at an unreadable line number.

## Architecture Notes

### Routing

`main.dart` uses `onGenerateRoute` with `PageRouteBuilder(transitionDuration: Duration.zero)` for instant navigation. The initial route uses `home: const HomeScreen()` — do NOT replace with `initialRoute` or `onGenerateInitialRoutes` as both crash on web.

### Croatian flag theme

Colors from the logo SVG:
- Red: `#FF0000` (`_croRed`)
- White: `#FFFFFF`
- Navy blue: `#002F6C` (`_croBlue`)

Theme seed: `Color(0xFF002F6C)` (Croatian navy).

### Social sharing

- Homepage: static OG tags in `web/index.html` + JSON-LD structured data
- Episode pages: dynamic OG injection in `web/_worker.js` (Cloudflare Worker)
- OG image: `web/og-image.png` (1200x630) generated from `assets/icons/og-image.svg`
- Test page: `https://domovina.ai/social-test`
- Test script: `node scripts/test-social-tags.mjs`
